                <p><strong>Dr. Stephen William Hawking</strong> (* 8 January 1942 in Oxford, England; â€  14 March 2018 in Cambridge, England) was an English theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and author who was director of research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology at the University of Cambridge at the time of his death.</p>
    
                <p>He is one of the most well known physicists of all time, with his scientific works including a collaboration work on gravitational singularity theorems in the framework of general relativity, the prediction of black holes emitting radiation (now often called <em>Hawking Radiation</em>), the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole_information_paradox">Black hole information paradox</a> and much, much more.<br/>
                   He also achieved great commercial success with his books like <em>A Brief History of Time</em>, which appeared on the Sunday Times bestseller list for a record-breaking 237 weeks, and received numerous honors, for example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Presidential Medal of Freedom</li>
                    <li>Fellow of the Royal Society</li>
                    <li>Lifetime member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences</li>
                </ul>
